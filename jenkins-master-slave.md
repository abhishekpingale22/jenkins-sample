### Distributed Jenkins Builds
- Distributed Builds run on nodes other than the master node.
  - Additional nodes are configured and the master node manages these nodes to do the actual build executions.

#### Master
- Serves HTTP requests
- Stores all important information

#### Distributed Builds Architecture


#### Advantages of Distributed Builds
- ${JENKINS_HOME} is protected from malicious builds
- Makes the Jenkins instance more scalable
- If you do not have enough resources to run your builds, just add more agents
- Distributes the build load for better resource utilization
- Run different operating systems, use different CPU architectures, or different JDK versions

### Distributed Jenkins Builds-Practical
- Here we can create nodes and agents to create a distributed Jenkins instance that is scalable and secure.
- The target is to have:
  - 2 ssh agents that handle builds
  - Each agent has 1 executor
    - We have 2 CPUs available; rule of thumb says ~2 executors
  - Consider that the master does not have any executors, so no builds run on master
- Login to Jenkins Home Console
Start by logging into http://localhost:5000/jenkins using the following credentials:
    Username: butler
    Password: butler
- To managed nodes using Jenkins, navigate to:
  - Go to Manage Jenkins â†’ Managed Nodes
Please note that the lab instance is already configured with two agents. We will first go ahead and delete those.

    You will see two agents, jdk7-node and jdk-8-node
